#### About the project
Some years ago I wanted to craft a home media center when nobody wanted to. 
There were not any distro done, no resources on the Internet and I had to create it from scratch. 
These scripts were the result of that.

#### Documentation
This project is not well documented because I abandoned it decades ago. 
You can test it installing Debian Wheezy on a VM and visiting the wiki to know more
